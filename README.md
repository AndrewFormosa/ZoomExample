## ZOOM Project _ Java programing

### Personal Project Aims

I recalled watching an Open University lecture in around 1985 on BBC2, aged 12, on how how to create Vector graphics and decided to set myself a challenge to create a 3D vector graphics environment using only basic geometry (Sin, Cos, Tan, Pythagoras).
</br>
I used Java to write the code to test my logic and maths, and this was the result.
</br>
I created a simple plain, with various sized cubes etc. that you can fly around.
